## Project aims ##

This project set out with the following hypotheses:
- Free entitlement funding is not at the required levels and early years settings are faced with financial difficulties.
- Settings make difficult economic assessments when deciding to take in a child with additional needs because of cost pressures.
- There is some regional variation in free entitlement rates with regions outside of London receiving the lowest rate of hourly funding for three and four-year-old children.
- Some authorities are below the 95% pass-through which was intended to stop councils underspending their early year's budget.

## Possible solutions devised by industry experts ##

Based on several interviews with academics, researchers and staff, here are four possible solutions to sector challenges:

**Funding children based on their needs**

Currently, all children are given a base rate and then extra funding is given for those with additional needs. This policy change would separate children with and without special educational needs. A child with SEN should not be in the same funding bracket as the rest of the children. The policy would set a clear base rate and then for children with moderate needs or high needs, they would get a tailored funding rate to help deliver the best outcomes.

**Scrap the 95% pass-through rate and give settings 100%**

This change would intend to avoid any underspend by giving providers complete control over the funding they receive from the government. Local authorities would also not be involved so, funding goes directly to the setting. Councils would still assist with safeguarding issues etc. Additional supplements are separate from the base funding rate.

**Improve early years knowledge of headteachers in primary schools**

To ease the transition from pre-school to reception headteachers would be encouraged to have early years training to improve their knowledge. Children would then benefit from being in an environment that continues their education and development. Reception classes should also have an early years specialist with decision-making power.

**Emphasise new language for the sector**

To change the perception of the early years simply being seen as a babysitting service and a place for children to play, everyone needs to use different words to describe the sector. This starts from the top through the government. Avoid words such as childcare and practitioners. Also, more awareness needs to be raised of how important and valuable the sector is. Stress the challenges and the importance of brain development from the ages of 0-5.

## Data journalism

The project provided an opportunity to incorporate data journalism. This included free entitlement rates, attendance and Covid-19 cases in settings.
