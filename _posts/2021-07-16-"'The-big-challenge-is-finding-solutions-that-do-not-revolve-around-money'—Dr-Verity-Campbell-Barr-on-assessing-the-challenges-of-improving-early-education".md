  <p><b>"I feel like a broken record, but historical studies show that early childhood education and care offers value for money. I think it offers so much more value than those economic assessments could ever capture. However, it is a sector underfunded and providers are struggling".</p></b>
  <p><a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/verity-campbell-barr">Dr Verity Campbell-Barr</a>is the Associate Head for Research and Associate Professor in Early Childhood Studies at the University of Plymouth. Throughout her time in the sector, she has emphasized the supply and demand of early years provision. From her PhD to working for a local authority, the challenge was figuring out how settings can provide high-quality services and ensure the best possible outcomes for children</p>
  
  <h3> Balancing care and affordability </h3>
  <br>
  <p>Financially, pre-schools and nurseries have been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-55665962">impated by the pandemic</a>. But, as recent revelations show, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/15/ministers-knowingly-underfunding-childcare-sector-england">monetary constraints on the sector</a> have already been an issue for a long time. Supplying effective early education for children requires funding and highly qualified staff. Yet, the level of funding is leaving “settings with a balancing act”, says Verity.</p>
  
  <p>“At the core of what providers are doing is working with families and they do not want to charge them extortionate rates. How do you do that caring side of the job while at the same time make your setting financially viable? We have seen a massive drop in funding and the <a href="https://connectpa.co.uk/party-parliamentary-group-childcare-early-education/">APPG</a> highlighted this and whether the rates are covering costs". </p>
  
  <p>The All Party Parliamentary Group for Childcare and Early Education (APPG) brings together members of parliament representatives from the early years sector. Recently, the group discussed funding and talked in length about why the <a href="https://connectpa.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Steps-to-sustainability-report.pdf">current system is problematic</a>. This includesissues with staff retention, funding gaps and business rates.</p>
  
  <p>Although, do solutions lie where money is not the focal point?</p>
  
  <p>“The big challenge is finding solutions that do not revolve around money. We need to think about how else we might go about changing things without impacting quality”. </p>
