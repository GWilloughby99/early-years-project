        <h1 style="font-size:40px;">Understanding free entitlement concerns</h1>
        <p>Free entitlement is a certain number of hours offered to parents to care for their children. To fund their education, the government sets a funding rate through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2021-to-2022">national funding formula</a>. The money is given to local authorities and then passed onto early years settings.</p>

        <p>Recently, a spending review was rejected by the government after a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/586700">petition that received over <b>100,000</b> signatures</a>. The Early Years Alliance (EYA) also <a href="https://www.eyalliance.org.uk/freedom-information-investigation-findings">won a Freedom of Information (FOI) dispute</a> with the Department for Education. Their findings revealed the early years sector is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/15/ministers-knowingly-underfunding-childcare-sector-england">underfunded</a>. </p>

        <p>Despite the FOI findings and public support for a review, the current funding rates will continue. Children and early years providers could be missing out on thousands of pounds. The monetary shortfall can be calculated through the funding system and using research from the <a href="https://epi.org.uk/research-area/early-years-development/">Education Policy Institute</a>.</p>

        <h1> The pass-through rate </h1>
<br>
        <p>Settings need to receive a sufficient sum of funding to pay their staff. As well, achieve high-quality outcomes for children and be sustainable. To ensure providers stay financially viable, the government introduced a <b>95% pass-through</b> rate. Councils must give providers an equivalent of 95% of the free entitlement funding.</p>

        <p>The introduction of the pass-through rate was to stop councils underspending. Occasionally, some councils might justify being below the threshold because they support providers in other ways. For example, helping to fund extra training or provide guidance on safeguarding issues. But, this is not the case across all areas.</p>

        <iframe title="The hourly free entitlement funding rate for three and four-year-olds" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-5klTw" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5klTw/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="435"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
<br>
<br>
        <p>Another reason a council might not pass through 95% is that they project higher costs in the future. The Early Years Alliance said that these kinds of contingencies could be problematic. </p>

        <blockquote>"Local authorities are permitted to keep money back if they think they will have higher future costs. The rate this is happening at is not counted and it is unclear what happens to the money if the council then later decides costs have not gone up for whatever reason and the money is 'not needed', whether it stays in the sector budget and how it is spent."</blockquote>

        <p>By not making it compulsory to give settings 100% of the entitlement funding, providers are potentially missing out on hundreds of pounds every year. This is money that could go towards the education and development of children.</p>

        <p>A difference of 0.20p per hour could lead to better outcomes for children. For each region in England, the upcoming charts show how much money settings miss out on due to the pass-through threshold. </p>

        <p>The figures were calculated using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-funding-2021-2022">average funding rate given to authorities</a> and what the 95% pass-through requirement would be. The difference was then calculated across a 38 week year with a six-hour working day from 9-3. The yearly amount is not representative of all local authorities because some are above or below the pass-through rate. </p>

        <p>By not giving providers <b>100%</b> of the money through the national funding formula, providers potentially miss out on hundreds of pounds.<a href="#story/950720/slide-1"></a></p>

        <p>The difference is only around 20p a child, but over a year, the money is significant. The chart shows the total amount of funding that a provider could receive in regions in England per year for <b>one child</b>.<a href="#story/950720/slide-1"></a></p>

        <p>For <b>one child</b> across a <b>38-week</b> year in the Inner London region, on average, they would be entitled to a further <b>£334</b> to go towards their education. <a href="#story/950720/slide-2"></a></p>

        <p>The first figure was for a 38-week year. This will not be the same for all pre-school and nurseries as some might be open for <b>51-weeks</b>. <a href="#story/950720/slide-3"></a></p>

        <p>Across <b>51 weeks</b>, providers could receive even greater levels of funding. <a href="#story/950720/slide-4"></a></p>

        <p>Nationally, the average yearly amount a setting could receive if the 95% pass-through was scrapped is <b>£383</b> for a <b>51-week</b> year. <a href="#story/950720/slide-5"></a></p>

        <p>Dr Verity Campbell-Barr, Associate Early Years professor at the University of Plymouth, believes the pass-through scheme could create a perception that settings are not trusted with the funding they receive.</p>

        <p>She said: “Nothing is going straight to the provider. Why do they not get the money directly? It does seem like a strange process. There are issues with how the funding is allocated and, I do not think we have done a proper economic assessment to see what the costs are.”</p>

        <p>The Early Years Alliance also raised concerns regarding transparency. They said:</p>

        <blockquote> "The way money is paid through Local authorities (LAs) adds a barrier for anyone trying to understand whether local authorities are paying a fair rate to providers. But it also masks the fact that fundamentally, the pot given to local authorities by the central government to fund early years provision is well short of the cost of delivery. Which LA you are in can have a significant effect but unless LAs have a larger funding pot to begin with, they do not have the money to pay for the full cost of providing places, or associated costs like SEND." </blockquote>  

        <h1> The funding required to cover early education </h1>
<br>
        <p> The Education Policy Institute (EPI) produced an hourly rate that would cover a three to four-year-olds education. The director of early years, <a href="https://epi.org.uk/team/sara-bonetti/">Dr Sara Bonetti</a>, conveyed her organisation's findings at the most recent All Party Parliamentary Group for Childcare and Education. This group brings together leading members in the sector and parliamentarians to discuss policy issues. </p>

<br>
        <p>The EPI, through a pilot of <b>200 settings</b>, devised a figure of <b>£7.17 per hour</b>. Every region in England was below this rate for funding three and four-year-old children. </p>

        <iframe title="Regions are below the funding rate to fully cover the cost of educating children" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-vTo8Z" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vTo8Z/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="735"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

        <p> Providers in London regions are receiving a higher average hourly rate compared to the rest of the country. The figures for Inner London show that settings in this region are almost fully funded using the EPI pilot study. Per hour, the average rate given was <b>£7.11</b>. Early years settings in Outer London were also closer to the EPI hourly rate. </p>

        <p> The region that receives the lowest average hourly rate is Yorkshire and the Humber. This was calculated using the latest national funding formula rates set by the government. Some local authorities in the region might provide a higher rate, but overall, funding levels are not covering the cost of early childhood education. </p>

        <p> On average, the rate given to local authorities is <b>£4.52</b> — <b>£2.65</b> per hour less than the EPI pilot study rate. A child will not attend a setting every day of the week. However, over a year based on the current funding rates, a child in twice a week is potentially losing out thousands. </p>


<br>
        <div class="flourish-embed" data-height="80vh" data-src="story/954994" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/story/954994/embed"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p>Using the <b>£2.65</b> difference the funding shortfall can be calculated. Excluding holiday club and bank holidays, a year is 38 weeks. The hours in a day is for a child attending a setting from 9-3 (six hours).<a href="#story/954994/slide-1"></a></p>

        <p>Over a year, a child that attends a setting one day a week could miss out on an extra <b>£500</b> towards their education.<a href="#story/954994/slide-1"></a></p>

        <p>If a child attends more days during the week, the figure increases. Two days a week increases the amount to over <b>£1,000</b> a year. <a href="#story/954994/slide-2"></a></p>

        <p>The figure for a child in a setting three days a week is <b>£1,525.</b><a href="#story/954994/slide-3"></a></p>

        <p>The amount of money providers could be investing in early education continues to rise. Children attending four days a week in Yorkshire and the Humber are potentially missing out on just over <b>£2,000 a year.</b> <a href="#story/954994/slide-4"></a></p>

        <p>Finally, if a child was to go to their provider five days a week, the shortfall reaches <b>£2,500</b>. This is just the yearly amount for one child. <a href="#story/954994/slide-5"></a></p>

        <p>The EPI pilot study was limited to 200 settings. But, it could indicate the current funding levels are not covering the cost of providing children with early education.<a href="#story/954994/slide-6"></a></p>

        <p>Some settings might also be open for 51 weeks in the year. The potential missed funding is even more substantial. <a href="#story/954994/slide-7"></a></p>

<br>

          <h1> Regional variation in the national funding formula </h1>
<br>
        <p> The current system is structured so that money from the government goes through authorities and not to the early year's settings directly. Local authorities can be below the 95% pass-through rate only by reaching an equivalent amount. This can be through deprivation, quality and flexibility supplements. Also disability and Special Educational Needs (SEN) inclusion funds. How much additional support an authority can provide is also dependent on the rate they receive through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2021-to-2022">national funding formula</a>. </p>

        <p> The latest figures show that some regions receive a lower rate per hour in the funding formula. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-national-funding-formula/guide-to-national-funding-formula">Funding is calculated</a> based on the attendance at the setting in the previous October school census and pupil characteristics. Every child gets a base rate and further funding is for children with additional needs. Local authorities set the rate they give to providers. Yet, this is influenced by how much they get from the government. </p>

        <p> Regions outside of London are more likely to receive the lowest hourly rate through the national funding formula. </p>

        <p>Lancashire is one of 10 local authorities in the North West that receives the lowest rate of funding. The authority gets <b>£4.44</b> per hour for free and four-year-old children. This is just <b>over 50p</b> an hour less than the average across all other authorities. Yet, Lancashire has a pass-through rate of <b>98%</b> which, is above what is required.</p>

        <p><b>County Councillor Jayne Rear, cabinet member for education and skills</b>, said:</p>

        <blockquote>"The county council is committed to high-quality provision for its early year's settings to ensure that the children of Lancashire have the best start in life. However, Lancashire along with about one third of other local authorities, receives the lowest Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) Early Years Block allocation rate nationally under the DfE's early years funding formula. We know that providers in our early years sector are facing considerable cost pressures so, we want to maximise the funding that is available to them."</blockquote>

        <!-- <p> Deprivation funding is commonly based on the <a href="https://lginform.local.gov.uk/reports/lgastandard?mod-metric=3910&mod-area=E92000001&mod-group=AllRegions_England&mod-type=namedComparisonGroup">Income deprivation affecting children index</a>. This uses postcodes so if a child it one of those recognised postcodes, they would be eligible. The same applies for disability and SEN funds. Children without additional needs will not be entitled to the higher levels of funding. </p> -->
